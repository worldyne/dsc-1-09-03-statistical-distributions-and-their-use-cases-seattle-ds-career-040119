    "\n",
    "Data scientists have to choose probability distributions routinely. This includes selecting which distribution is most representative of the given data, in order to conduct an analytics experiment such as A/B testing. Distributions are to statistical analysis what data structures are to computer programming. There are literally thousands of distributions to study, although most of them are not very common. In the upcoming series of lessons, we will look at ways to analyze common distributions you are apt to encounter.\n",

    "The statistical distributions show all the possible values of the data and how often they occur. For example, we can view the raw frequency of events or the percentage of time each event occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about distributions, we also make the distinction between **discrete** and **continuous** variables. Discrete data can only take on set values, while continuous data can take on any possible value within a range. The outcomes from rolling a dice or tossing a coin are discrete; in the first case possible values are 1-6 while in the second options are Heads or Tails (often such binary variables are coded as 0/1). In contrast, a quantity such as temperature can take on any value within a certain range. The temperature could not only be 20 degrees, 21 degrees or 22 degrees, but it could also be 20.5, 20.05, 20.005, etc. leading to infinite possibilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with **discrete** data we use a **probability mass function (PMF)**. When dealing with **continuous** data, we use a **probability density function (PDF)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pmf_pdf.png\">\n",
    "Based on the variation of their attributes, data distributions can take many shapes and forms. The key parameters to describe random variables as distrubtions are statistical mean and variance of random data variable. Statistical variance gives a measure of how the data distributes itself about the Statistical Mean (or the **Expected Value** of data). Specifically, the variance measures the average distance of how far data points are from the mean of the data.\n",

    "### The Bernoulli Distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "(The Bernoulli distribution is also called the binomial distribution.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The bernoulli distribution represents the probability of $x$ successes in $n$ trials for a binomial variable (only 2 cases). Lots of textbooks use coin flipping examples, but the two outcomes can also have different probabilities such as the chance of success being 20%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometric\n",
    "The geometric distribution also deals with repeated trials from a binomial variable. Rather then investigate the probability of $x$ successes in $n$ trials, the geometric distribution examines the probability that the first success will occur on trial n. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Poisson\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution represents the probability of n events in a given time period when the overall rate of occurence is constant. The classic example is pieces of mail. If your overall mail received is constant, the number of items received on a single day (or month) is apt to follow a poisson distribution. Other examples might include visitors arriving on a website, or customers arrive at a store, or clients waiting to be served in some kind of queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uniform Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The uniform distribution occurs when all possible outcomes are equally likely. An example might include the probability of a train arriving at any given time, or the probabilities for rolling a 1-6 on a single die. The uniform distribution is both a continuous and discrete distribution, occuring in both contexts. "
